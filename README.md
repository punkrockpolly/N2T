Code for the exercises in the book, The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

<b>Course overview:</b> The course objective is to integrate key notions from algorithms, computer 
architecture, operating systems, compilers, and software engineering in one unified framework. 
This will be done constructively, by building a general-purpose computer system from the ground 
up. In the process, we will explore many ideas and techniques used in the design of modern 
hardware and software systems, and discuss major trade-offs and future trends. Throughout this 
journey, you will gain many cross-section views of the computing field, from the bare bone details 
of switching circuits to the high level abstraction of object-based software design.
